# Portfolio Website

A concise, responsive portfolio website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## What I completed

- Built responsive layout and styles for desktop and mobile
- Implemented interactive UI with JavaScript (mobile nav, smooth scrolling, contact form validation)
- Added sections: **Hero**, **About**, **Skills**, **Projects**, **Contact**
- Performed simple optimizations (images, semantics, basic SEO)

## Files

- `index.html` — main markup
- `styles.css` — styles and responsive rules
- `script.js` — interactive behavior

## How to run

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Customize content and replace `profile-photo.jpg` with your photo
